    hashword.init(12);
    
    //Generate a random string of 10 characters.
    var password = hashword.generatePassword(10);
    
    //Generate hash of the password with a random key.

## Performance / Benchmark ##

I have added a simple benchmark against BCrypt for generating hash and comparing password.

On average Hashword turns out to be **20% faster** than BCrypt.
